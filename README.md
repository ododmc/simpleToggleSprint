# simpleToggleSprint

#### The main available ToggleSprint in Forge for 1.8.9 Minecraft comes down to two types: ToggleSneak mods that often have features banned on servers, or the one included in Orange's Simple Mods, which has features bundled that are often not wanted, or included in other mods. This version of a ToggleSprint is a standalone version of OrangeMarshall's type, with a message in chat when activated/deactivated.
